## Broadcast


### 2019-07-10 | A short style guide for updating this `CHANGELOG.md`.
* The `CHANGELOG.md` has three sections.
    * **Broadcast**: Briefing of upcoming events or reminders (like this one).
    * **Meeting**: Summaries for meetings.
    * **Development Journal**: Records for development updates.
* For the sake of consistency, I suggest we update this `CHANGELOG.md` in a date descending order (new-to-old) with a headline format of `YYYY-MM-DD | Highlight | Name`. Note the `Highlight` and `Name` parts can be omitted if not applicable, e.g.
    * This broadcast headline, which omits `Name`.
    * Under **Development Journal** as `2019-04-10 | Henry Zhong`, which omits `Highlight`.

Presented a runnable demo only on [a specific dummy data set](https://github.com/choH/half_tael_DQN/tree/v2.0/DQV_v2.5/EUR_GBP.csv) -- Henry.
        * Main works presented as [f7259b3](https://github.com/choH/half_tael_DQN/commit/f7259b3eff2cf9e0d9886ea613d87bee958bdb68). Stored as [DQN_v2.5](https://github.com/choH/half_tael_DQN/tree/v2.0/master/DQN_v2.5).

        * Absent, but marked as "green check" since goal (DQN v2.5) accomplished -- Henry.

### 2019-08-07 | Scrum #6 | Henry, Steven.
* **Henry**
    1. ‚úÖ Understand CNN basic.
* **Steven**
    1. ‚úÖ Fully understand the basic of CNN as in the relationship between `w_1`, `b_1`, `n_features`, and input `data_env`
    * ‚ùå üöß DQN v2.5.
        * Postpone to 2019-08-09, but made significant progress on understanding the mapping of matrix convolution.

### 2019-08-06 | Scrum #5 | Henry, Steven.
* ~~Steven absent, postpone to 2019-08-06 to discuss DQN v2.5.~~
* ‚ùå üöß DQN v2.5.
    * Tried to utilize CNN to scan input with multiple dimension (support trading among multiple (>2) currencies). But it is indeed technically challenged since:
        * The original DQN v1.0 (and also DQN v2.0) was built on a modification of Morvan's environment, which only considered one-dimensional input.
        * There aren't too much readable TensorFlow CNN+DQN source code we can referenced on. And it will forgo a serious portion of work on DQN v1.0 and v2.0 if we want to redesign our environment base on another project.
    * Resolution: Steven will try to deliver his demo by Scrum #6 (2019-08-07). If not, we will shift focus from Morvan to another tutorial and redesign the environment. We want to stick with Morvan if possible as DQN v2.0 is fully developed, but as the reward part is relatively stand-alone from DQN v1.0 but more coupled to the trading platform (which is fully developed and will keep using), the cost is still acceptable as long as we can quickly implement the transformation code to change the environment from pixel games to numerical forex market.

        * ‚ùå Did not delivery as Jian believes it is not feasible to do it stand-alone (without the DQN code).
            * After discussion, we all agree it is doable and such task is postpone to 2019-07-30.
        * ‚úÖ Introduced some fundamental DQN features (remember, replay).

### 2019-07-19 | Scrum #1 | Henry, Steven.
* **Goals**
    * **ALL**:
        1. Get familiar with basic Q-learning and DQN concept in general.
    * **Henry**:
        1. Build a basic wrapper to communicate with [OANDA](https://www.oanda.com/us-en/) API as the backend of the project. Anul's code [`Oanda_Trader.py`](placeholder) can be use as reference.
    * **Steven**:
        1. Run a trial DQN model on ~~SP 500~~ [`USD_JPY_0.csv`](https://github.com/choH/half_tael_DQN/blob/master/dummy_data/USD_JPY_0.csv).
            * Task change due to CSV file of foreign exchange between USD and JPY is easily obtainable -- Henry.
    * **Jian**:
        1. ~~Research and present some insight regarding the possible designs of DQN model.~~
        * Understand the concept of [Anita](https://www.graphen.ai/dev/anita/), and define a quantified standard for "trading personality" according to [Mapping Personality Traits to Investment Behavior (Revised)](https://github.com/choH/half_tael_DQN/blob/master/legacy_ref/anita/Mapping%20Personality%20Traits%20to%20Investment%20Behavior%20(Revised).pptx) and [Strategies and Metrics.xlsx](https://github.com/choH/half_tael_DQN/blob/master/legacy_ref/anita/Strategies%20and%20Metrics.xlsx)
            * Task change due to update form Dr. Lin regarding [Anita](https://www.graphen.ai/dev/anita/). As "trading bot with personalities" is the unique selling point of this project, we should only research in designs which are compatible with such idea. Thus we should quantify the concept of "trading personality" first -- Henry.

### 2019-07-11 | Kick-off briefing | Anul Sinha, Henry, Jian, Steven.
* Anul gave a presentation of his `forex` side-project, mainly regarding the method of interaction with OANDA, his model try-out, and why he abandoned this project.
* Due to the lacks of documentation of Anul's work, we decided to not to take over his project (also because he has moved on to a more combined design base on his `forex`), but to build our own bot. However, we will take his code as an important reference, especially regarding the OANDA API part and model environment setup.

    * A "first-draft" [user manual for `anita_interface.py`](https://github.com/choH/half_tael_DQN/blob/anita_v2.0/demo_and_manual/User%20Manual%20for%20anita_interface.py.md) is also written by [`f73a207`](https://github.com/choH/half_tael_DQN/commit/f73a207e5f0e8ff7db64bcdbdd4bb66a9885e7f5)
### 2019-08-25 | half_tael_DQN v4.0 release | Henry.
* Check [half_tael_DQN v4.0: DQN_v3.0 with improved cohesion, textual output, and documentation](https://github.com/choH/half_tael_DQN/releases/tag/v4.0).
    * Most effort spent into documenting the project.

### 2019-08-16 | half_tael_DQN v3.0 release | Henry.
* Check [half_tael_v3.0: Refactor DQN_v2.5 to work with virtual trading platform](https://github.com/choH/half_tael_DQN/milestone/5?closed=1).
    * Most effort spent into [Replace hardcore setting in half_tael_v3.0 model to accept dynamic input](https://github.com/choH/half_tael_DQN/issues/17) by [3ef23cf](https://github.com/choH/half_tael_DQN/commit/3ef23cf8e6bebec8754116296b71142e718c3770).

### 2019-08-15 | Bugfix cost converges too quick & smooth | Henry.
* Fixed the issued regarding [Cost (loss) graph converges way too quick and smooth](https://github.com/choH/half_tael_DQN/issues/15).
    * Wrong index for `a, r` in `batch_memory` while retrieving `eval_act_index`. So when replacing the reward(s), it is not the `a, r` being replaced, but two `_close` prices data at `batch_memory[: , self.n_features]` and `batch_memory[: , self.n_features + 1]` (therefore it is usually `0` or `1` as we use `as type(int)` during the retrieval) .
    * Changed to:


        ```
        eval_act_index = batch_memory[:, self.n_features * self.n_currencys].astype(int)
        reward = batch_memory[: , self.n_features * self.n_currencys + 1]
        ```    
     and fixed the bug in commit [d2fa6e7](https://github.com/choH/half_tael_DQN/commit/d2fa6e7a6b5fd7187fb7d41cc03cb269e05b49be).

* Partially removed hardcore code regarding `self.n_features` and `self.n_currency`.
    * CNN `conv2d()` part not yet done, but fixed all reshape-related setting to accept dynamic input.


### 2019-08-14 | Redesigned seetings of CNN  | Henry, with help from [Ziyu, CHEN](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zailchen17/).

* As Steven X. is absent for three days and unresponsive on IM for four days probably due to some unexpected urgencies, I seek Ziyu for help.
* Ziyu noticed the original `strides` were set to `strides = [1, 2, 25, 1]`, combine with`padding = 'SAME'` and `filter = [6, 6, 1, 32]` on input `[-1, 3, 300, 1]`, which effectively "over-padded" the input. as:

    \\[
    W_{out} = \frac{W - F_W + 2P}{S_W} + 1 \\
    \Rightarrow 300 = \frac{300 - 6 + 2P}{25} + 1  \ \ \Rightarrow P = 3603 \ (\text{too many}) \\
    H_{out} = \frac{H - F_H + 2P}{S_H} + 1 \\
    \Rightarrow 3 = \frac{3 - 6 + 2P}{2} + 1  \ \ \Rightarrow P = 1.5 \ (\text{not int?}) \\
    \\]

* We adjusted the setting to be:

    ```
    strides = [1, 1, 1, 1]
    filter = [3, 3, 1, 32]
    ```
* I also adjusted the reshape setting in `l1` from `32` to `3200` to work with `stride = [1, 1, 1, 1]` as there will be more output:

    ```
    W_fc1 = self.weight_variable([3 * 3200, 100])
    h_pool1_flat = tf.reshape(h_pool1, [-1, 3*3200])
    ```
    Otherwise the line will break on:

    ```
    q_target[batch_index, eval_act_index] = reward + self.gamma * np.max(q_next, axis=1)

    # Before adjustment
    # q_target[batch_index, eval_act_index].shape: (32, 7)
    # q_target.shape: (3200, 7)
    # np.max(q_next, axis =1): (3200, 7)
    ```

* Problem regarding cost converging too fast and smooth remains unsolved, updated [`cost_log.txt`](https://github.com/choH/half_tael_DQN/commit/7c081777ae285053d288ebf1abc53a4cc66fb27d) for future investigation.
    * After discussion with Ziyu, it is believed that the CNN part is correctly implemented, but mostly on the DQN part ‚Äî however Ziyu is not particularly familiar with DQN, I will therefore continue the investigation. It is probably just a simple overfit issue as we only feeds `300` rows of train data and `300` rows of test data chronologically right after the training set, due to the power limitation of the laptop.



### 2019-08-13 | Refactored DQN_v2.5 to work with the trading platform | Henry.
* Be able to trade among three currencies with hardcore setting used in [`RL_brain.py`](https://github.com/choH/half_tael_DQN/commit/5ce65e38a0fdb52e428a2963e8bada26e299fb21).
* Problem regarding cost converging too fast and smooth remains unsolved, [`cost_log.txt`](https://github.com/choH/half_tael_DQN/commit/0d7164e8ce7b0621088a3715c014f630048bf799) saved for future investigation.

### 2019-08-11 | Bugfix and partial adjustments on DQN_v2.0, DQN_v2.5 delivered | Henry.
* Debugged on Steven's sketch code [ef6e716](https://github.com/choH/half_tael_DQN/commit/ef6e716af132541a0720bcb456f602c4f13cba06) with various `reshape` manipulations regarding `self.memory`, `store_transition` and `batch_memory`'s slicing in `feed_dict`.
* Several cosmetic on monitory print-outs.
* [Cost converges unreasonable fast and smooth](https://github.com/choH/half_tael_DQN/tree/v2.0/DQV_v2.5/cost_log.txt), potentially overfit, need investigation.

### 2019-08-09 | Debug DQN_v2.0 | Henry, Steven.
* Debug DQV_v2.0
    * solved bugs related to `self.s` and `self.s_` for `placeholder` and `reshape`.
    * solved bugs related to `self.x` and `self.x_` on `conv2d()`.
    * Work in progress on figuring out the bugs related to:

    ```
    transition = np.hstack((s, [a, r], s_))
    index = self.memory_counter % self.memory_size
    self.memory[index, :] = transition
    ```

### 2019-08-08 | Legacy Anita plot hole discovered | Henry.

* **Findings:**
    * After some careful review of [legacy_ref/anita folder](https://github.com/choH/half_tael_DQN/tree/master/legacy_ref/anita), I found that the mapping is between **personality** and **financial products**. e.g. (letter referred Big Five Personality Traits)
        * A persona with high E and low N is good for small cap investment.
        * A person with high C, high E, low A, low N is good for foreign exchange investment.
    * There are also many disparities between the [presentation slides](https://github.com/choH/half_tael_DQN/blob/master/legacy_ref/anita/Mapping%20Personality%20Traits%20to%20Investment%20Behavior%20(Revised).pptx) and the [metrics spreadsheet](https://github.com/choH/half_tael_DQN/blob/master/legacy_ref/anita/Strategies%20and%20Metrics.xlsx). e.g.
        * Slides indicate *"Momentum Investing (med-high c, high e, high a),"* but OCEAN value being 41.25, 40, 36.875, 36.25, and 35 respectively. Where the "mid-high C" is higher than the "high E" and "high A."
        * Slide indicate *"Income Investing (medium-high e, high n),"* but OCEAN value being 36.25, 35, 30, 30, and 32.5. Where the "mid-high E" is in fact the lowest value among five, and the supposedly "high N" ranks only among middle.


* **Conclusion:** Thus, this is essentially useless to our model as it cannot evaluate if a `trade_action` fits a given personality of not.
* **Solution:** My thinking is I will discard all Anita legacy and use some technical/fundamental analysis indicators to evaluate the "suitableness between a `trade_action` and given indicator" and therefore influent the reward. How a personality is defined by the indicators will left to future development.


### 2019-08-01 | Delivered half_tael_v2.0 running on DQN v2.0 | Henry.
* Implemented `balance_protection` feature on `trade_interface.py`. If the balance of sell currency is not enough to execute the requested trade, such trade will be canceled. The trade log will mark such trade as "failed." ([commit `#b735aff`](https://github.com/choH/half_tael_DQN/commit/b735aff1ccaf9ff9b34e6b6a215974597ef54e58))
* Discussed with Steven on the action update policy, decided the model does not need to know if an action is actually executed since the NN design will understand that at this `state` the `x` action will have bad reward (since equal balance will result in a reward of `-1`).
* Delivered half_tael_v2.0 by [commit `#6a051da`](https://github.com/choH/half_tael_DQN/commit/6a051dab9e63ec483e97f8b39b5fe6e1d5910e3f), Still hardcored to GBP due to the fact that DQN v1.0 only supports two-currency. Thus the non-base_currency is set manually. Will automate such part when refactoring with DQN v2.5 to avoid reengineering.  
    * Check [milestone #2](https://github.com/choH/half_tael_DQN/milestone/2?closed=1).

### 2019-07-31 | Starting to refactor DQN v1.0 | Henry.
* Till [30ec22c](https://github.com/choH/half_tael_DQN/commit/30ec22c343cb27f5338b1454d63b035df3b340ec), a understanding of DQN v1.0 is built.
* Bug fix on account cumulation with `execute_trade()` from `trade_interface.py`.
* Update hardcore setting (`n_features = 300`, record length to `4800` etc, currency as `EUR` and `GBP`) with relatively more universal adaptability.
* Work in progress on [commit `#0e0b676`](https://github.com/choH/half_tael_DQN/commit/0e0b6766cff67db23e79430caccd9726dc06b93ac), as a redesign of exception handling on `currency_balance[_sell_currency] < 0` is needed.
    * Ask Steven if the model need to know that some of its actions are not executed due to the balance issue.


### 2019-07-30 | Finished basic DQN learning | Henry.
* Finished most DQN part ([4.3](https://morvanzhou.github.io/tutorials/machine-learning/reinforcement-learning/4-3-DQN3/), up to date with what DQN v1.0 uses).
    * Check [issue #2](https://github.com/choH/half_tael_DQN/issues/2).


### 2019-07-29 | Dev branches base on half_tael_v1.0 | Henry.
* Branches [half_tael_v2.0](https://github.com/choH/half_tael_DQN/tree/half_tael_v2.0), [DQN_v2.5](https://github.com/choH/half_tael_DQN/tree/DQN_v2.5), and [anita_v1.1](https://github.com/choH/half_tael_DQN/tree/anita_v1.1) checked out from this commit ‚Äî aka [Release half_tale_DQN v1.0: Virtual Trading Platform + Trial DQN](https://github.com/choH/half_tael_DQN/releases/tag/v1.0). ([commit `#113431e`](https://github.com/choH/half_tael_DQN/commit/113431e8247f200f5a0800b23e355072c5a9280b))

### 2019-07-26 | Initial commit for trial DQN between two currency | Steven, Henry.
* Initial commit for trial DQN between two currency -- Steven.
* Release tag v1.0 set -- Henry.
    * [half_tale_DQN v1.0: Virtual Trading Platform + Trial DQN](https://github.com/choH/half_tael_DQN/releases)

### 2019-07-25 | Draft contributors' guideline for the project | Henry.
* Research git `rebase` and git `branch`. Designed and drafted [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](https://github.com/choH/half_tael_DQN/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) by [commit `#dd7e0ce`](https://github.com/choH/half_tael_DQN/commit/dd7e0ce97c59fd023e22cda412bf0aa8ba18a44f) to specify the workflow of this project.

### 2019-07-24 | Discussed merging Steven's experimental DQN code with Henry's trading environment code | Henry, Steve.
* Discussed the design and concern of merging Steven's experimental DQN code with Henry's trading environment code, particularly in:
    * How to support trading between multiple currencies (> 2) while making the machine realize some `_close` value is in the same time.
    * Possibility of using `vector` as first layer nodes in ANN/RNN design.
    * How to deal with missing `np.nan` in `_close` columns.
        * Increase `request_interval` from `M1` to `M5`.
        * Fill in `np.nan` cell gradual increment/decrement according to non-empty neighborhood cells, while setting `_volume` to `0`.

### 2019-07-24 | Drafted [`User Manual for trade_interface.py.md`](https://github.com/choH/half_tael_DQN/blob/master/demo_and_manual/User%20Manual%20for%20%60trade_interface.py%60.md), implemented `checkout_all_in()` method | Henry.
* Drafted [`User Manual for trade_interface.py.md`](https://github.com/choH/half_tael_DQN/blob/master/demo_and_manual/User%20Manual%20for%20%60trade_interface.py%60.md) with demo code available at [`train_interface_demo.py`](https://github.com/choH/half_tael_DQN/blob/master/demo_and_manual/train_interface_demo.py).
* Implemented `checkout_all_in()` method in `trade_interface.py` to checkout all currency(s) in account to a particular currency (e.g. `USD`).
* Debugged with Steven on his trial DQN model.

### 2019-07-23 | Implemented custom exceptions handling, and stand alone training input portal | Henry.
* Now all input should goes to ‚Äî or in a form which is similar to ‚Äî `train_interface.py` with the login info saved in `config.py`
* Custom exceptions handling implemented, e.g.

    ```
    During self.get_arena()
    	<class 'trade_interface.OI_Onanda_Error'> is raised due to: {"errorMessage":"Insufficient authorization to perform request."}

    During self.get_currency_pairs()
    	<class 'trade_interface.TI_Account_Error'> is raised due to: No currency pair(s) between ('USD', 'JAY') from Oanda

    During self.account_input_eval()
    	<class 'trade_interface.TI_Account_Error'> is raised as: Invalid Oanda granularity input, self.request_interval: H20.

    During self.account_input_eval()
    	<class 'trade_interface.TI_Account_Error'> is raised as: Invalid account input, self.currency_balance['USD'] must be >= 0 (currently -10).

    During self.market_LUT()
    	<class 'trade_interface.TI_Market_LUT_Error'> is raised due to: Invalid time input: 2019-01-01T22:30:20.000000000Z

    During self.execute_trade()
    	<class 'trade_interface.TI_Market_LUT_Error'> is raised as: Time input: 2019-01-01T22:03:00.000000000Z returns np.nan

    During self.execute_trade()
    	<class 'trade_interface.TI_Execution_Error'> is raised as: USB or GBP is(are) not in ['USD', 'JPY', 'GBP']

    During self.execute_trade()
    	<class 'trade_interface.TI_Execution_Error'> is raised as: USD balance < 0 after trade action #0 (currently -127412000.00000001).

    During self.execute_trade()
    	<class 'trade_interface.TI_Execution_Error'> is raised as: _time 2019-01-01T22:29:00.000000000Z is earlier than pervious action's trade_time 2019-01-01T22:30:00.000000000Z in log.

    During self.account_input_eval()
    	<class 'trade_interface.TI_Account_Error'> is raised as: self.from_time 2019-01-01T00:00:00Z is earlier than self.to_time 2018-01-02T00:00:00Z.
    ```
* Add feature to retrieve one trade action by `action_id` from `trade_log`.


### 2019-07-22 | Fully supports trading among multiple currency | Henry.
* Bug fixed for perviously mentioned [commit `#8248b6f`](https://github.com/choH/half_tael_DQN/commit/8248b6ff8fbd73be7c2fc52935574d90ea422b9f), trading among multiple currency is now fully supported ([commit `#443e4d1`](https://github.com/choH/half_tael_DQN/commit/443e4d16b9baf9f1c0d23cf85e7aaa3376fec320)).

* Developed a set of wrapper functions in `oanda_interface.py`, which can interact with `oandapyV20` API and output pricing record according to user requested currency pair, start time, end time, interval.
* Output is available in both `DataFrame` and CSV file with command line confirmation on both request and export stage:
